 so since yesterday morning and before you've been [Music] chopping wood and carrying water one way or another being total with whatever you're doing at any moment or rather in the one moment expressed also in another zen saying that a master once answered when his disciples said they talked to him of another master who could walk on water and i said he can walk in water what can you do and he gave the famous reply when i'm hungry i eat when i'm tired i sleep doesn't everybody do that what he means is he does nothing else at that moment he has no stuff around eating when he eats and no stuff around sleeping when he goes to bed no resistance no demands this moment is just as it is there's no self that moves into the action whatever he's doing no expectation this moment is enough not expectation always implies you're hoping that some future moment will be fuller through this moment through doing something at this moment but if you haven't found the fullness of this moment you can't find the fullness no matter what the next moment contains because the next moment is this moment always when it comes so carrying the burden of self into what you do [Music] greatly reduces your sense of aliveness greatly reduces your intelligence intelligent not iq intelligence through deeper intelligence and makes life heavy because yourself the sense of me with its unfulfilled expectations of this or that or its complaints about what's not happening now or whatever it may be that's the happiness that then flows into what you do because every self is heavy there's then no lightness in life you could even have stuff around sitting here this moment not totally wanting to be here complaining about this or that carrying some memory from the past into here or very common thing would rather be somewhere else so we are not total not truly fully here because they self the burden of self which is mind stuff it's a self a conceptual self and it's in its very nature that it cannot be fulfilled in the present moment it looks always to the next moment its state is unfulfillment and that's not personal and the strange thing is this that sense of being unfulfilled makes up a large part of what people conceive of as themselves their personal sense of self it is all it is it's a mind pattern collective human mind pattern and it's mistaken for me my dilemma my sense of not enough and perhaps it was the buddha 2 600 years ago who was the first human i don't know who realized the illusion of self who realized the truth of no self in any form any thought any emotion any external form or internal form he realized the truth of anata there's no self in it and if you're looking for self there's two cab suffering so there's only suffering if you are looking for self in thought for self in an emotion if thought is endowed with a sense of self and every emotion is endowed with a sense of self is not recognized as just a human emotion passing through thoughts passing through or external situations where i'm looking for myself through something or other through some external possession through fame's recognition whatever it may be through my father or my mother understanding me so you cannot find yourself anywhere and so the buddhists have the strange expression no self as the essence sometimes even called and it's frightening to the ego emptiness it means is stillness a still mind or rather no mind emptiness and yet what is there when the mind is still there's something there but you cannot define it because it has no form something not even a thing any word you use is wrong because every word derives from the world of things remember to be here in touch with your inner energy field otherwise you'll become restless and start thinking when you become restless you've moved you've lost touch with a deeper sense of being and moved into the head and then unconscious body movements can sometimes happen emotions are also restless then but you are not usually conscious of it i can sometimes tell when people are not fully here their legs or feet start shaking their eyes go drifting [Music] they're looking for somewhere else some other place they've moved into the head in the meantime the legs go and it's quite normal many people spend a lot of time sitting like that if an animal did it we would have to take it to the vet because imagine your dog doing that and it's really obvious there's something wrong with the dog but with humans it's normal and when you notice it then something another dimension is coming you simply there's an awareness suddenly that your legs is the leg is shaking or the restlessness and suddenly you notice it you notice certain involuntary movements or whatever it is oh and that's very significant and noticing because awareness is their presence is there it's only then you can see what's going on inside you when there's no presence you don't know what's going on inside you because you're so identified with going on you are what is going on you don't know what's going on you have to you're acting it out you're in your actor who has forgotten that he or she is acting out the script you're totally in it and it's all conditioned and then people's behavior becomes predictable you can tell from people relatives and so on that you've known for a long time that most of people's behavior is predictable you can even predict what they're going to answer when you say something what their reaction is going to be predictable reaction but whatever you can observe in yourself means you're conscious enough to observe something in yourself that's all that's needed you don't really need to change anything as such because then you have another dilemma and that dilemma is part of many people's sense of self and that is there's something wrong with me and many people have that there's something wrong with me and i need to there's something i need to repair whatever it is now you could either say there are two statements we can make here and just two different perspectives on it and they're both right in their own way there's nothing wrong with you and there's something wrong with everybody as long as there's no presence of course there's dysfunction but the moment you notice that there's nothing wrong awareness is all that's needed presence is all that's needed for example when you become conscious of your leg shaking soon after it'll stop shaking because it was only shaking because you were unconscious of it you could it would be rare for a human to consciously shake their legs and say okay i'll just carry on shaking this leg they don't do it it's oh and then after a while it dies down because your attention was there it's flown into there and you see that and then it slows slows down and goes [Music] another one is to notice that you are unfriendly towards the present moment and that's it does that mean there's something wrong with you no it's you're something supremely right with you [Music] because you you are conscious you're aware that you're unfriendly with the present moment that's all that's needed if there's something wrong with you truly wrong you don't even know it so those humans with whom there is something wrong they have no idea they think they've done absolutely nothing wrong those who are the most extreme manifestations of human unconsciousness those human beings who go around with bombs or machine guns or throw whatever they throw they don't think there's anything wrong with them nothing wrong with me so everything wrong with them there so when you notice something hostility towards the present moment in whatever form oh [Music] there's nothing wrong presence is there the very purpose of your life on earth is fulfilling itself in that moment the arising of consciousness so what could possibly be wrong and yet the egoic identity the ego itself insists in many cases there is something wrong with me and it can sometimes obscure the awareness when you observe something in yourself such as hostility towards what is the present moment and that moment the mind can come in again and obscure the awareness that was there for a moment and formulate some kind of judgment it is a new thought and that judgment for example would say you see you're not good enough you can't do it you've been to the retreat plus 50 workshops before that and you see you still can't do it there's something wrong with you you see you're no good they look they're all present you're the only one who can't do it you might as well give up so when you observe something in yourself the mind may then come in obscure the presence that was there for a moment and make a thought out of it that has to do something with yourself to add something to your sense of self and so the heaviness of self can increase even there because when you become aware you all become aware you come of so many ways in which you create heaviness in your life in which you resist the present moment in which you add stuff to the chopping of the wood and the carrying of the water and the mental commentary while you carry the water oh this is this is awful how much how much longer she feels much heavier than yesterday why do i have to do this why don't they carry the water they should be stuff around what all kinds of mine stuff am i getting weaker which i can stop all kinds of whatever it is i shouldn't be carrying water i've been doing it for 10 years other it's other people's turn now this nobody nobody acknowledges me that i'm carrying this water they don't even thank me hard work carrying that water is hard work but eighty percent of the energy that is expanded on carrying the water is actually mind stuff the heaviness that the mind produces otherwise it would just be that it might be a heavy bucket but it's not really it's just easy so it's wonderful to realize there's nothing wrong with you and the more things you discover in yourself that had been unconscious the more you are fulfilling your destiny on the planet which is you become a manifestation of consciousness arising you go beyond the merely personal the delusion of a form identification a heavy thing for many people is the pain body which is the reason why many people think there's something very wrong with them because periodically they suffer an influx of heavy emotion painful emotion negative emotion fear deep sadness or very dark mood anger all kinds of forms of upset and even those who in whom consciousness is already arise presence is already arising they still find themselves in many cases at the mercy of the temporary the periodic arising of their pain body which is past pain remnants of past pain that are still alive and have accumulated inside you as a little entity personal plus collective part of it is the collective pain body it could be the collective pain body of your family that's part of your personal pain body or the collective pain body of the part of the world you live in [Music] it could be heavy some are heavier than others and certainly it will be also partly the suffering of humanity the collective pain body of humanity and everybody has his or her share of that and that is a little energy form in you and that's obviously that's what it is because everything every form is an energy form every thought is an energy form the table is an energy form just looks solid it isn't it was an amazing realization from physics it's 99 empty space but it looks solid same as the body 99.999 empty space so the pain body is energy and energy form one could say almost like a little entity made up of emotion an emotional entity i saw in a film recently a character that got closer to what the human pain body looks like and it's in the film lord of the rings a little being i can't remember the name gollum [Music] hmm but yet sometimes if you look it's very well done sometimes when you look into his eyes you see there's a being hiding in there there's even there there's a sweet being hiding in there somewhere and just the same the pain body is energy life energy trapped that's all created by the ego by thousands of years of living through an illusory sense of self and creating a reality on the basis of that illusion living in a world of enemies because that's the ego's world creating enemies wherever you go not being able to live without them making the whole world appear hostile towards you having to fear every little thing of course that creates a lot of pain and even though presence may be arising in you and in all of you it is you may still find yourself being taken over by that thing when it [Music] wakes up from its dormant stage might be dormant for a week or two or three or four and then at some point it wants to experience more pain it wakes up and then it it it tries to find out what's going on in your life right now it looks for an opening where it can go in into your mind and so that could be a slight upset with something while you're driving traffic the driver cuts across and there's a slide and at that moment the pain body uses that as an opening and flows into that little upset and then before you know it the little upset has developed into a stream of negative thinking about the world and in general and yourself and other people and the stupidity of them all and before you know it the little thing has grown into you something a huge field of heavy negative energy oh that's the pain body it used that little it was waiting for it and of course pain bodies help each other so the driver who cut across you was probably possessed by his papers i'm going to show him the phenomenon that's called road rage where two drivers stop their cars and start attacking each other physically means when two active pain bodies happen to meet on the road that can happen not only two active pain bodies but two active pain bodies into humans in whom not the slightest race of presence has yet arisen they are totally identified with that and they can't help it they're driven to it so the pain body becomes part of the self it amplifies the already heavy and dysfunctional self even without the influx of the heavy past emotion that is in the pain body so even in at the best of times there is a heaviness to the self to this that sense of self of me but that becomes amplified through the old emotion of the pain body it uses the structures the mind structures of the ego itself and flows into them and then they become it's like putting higher voltage into the into the heaviness of the ego and the dysfunction of it you just plug it into and so there you have all the egoic structures plus an enormous amount of emotion raw needing desperately to experience some more drama or pain wanting more pain and one way of looking at that is that is in human beings the addiction to emotional pain that's the pain body and if you ever discover that in yourself that that moment you loving it indulging in negative thinking for example which is one way in which the pain body renews itself feeding on your thinking your thought every thought feeds it and the emotion fuels the negative thinking the thinking feeds the emotion the emotion fuels the thinking the thinking feeds the emotion vicious circle can go on and it's great don't want to get up then at that moment you don't want to get out of your pain so if the pain body may be feeding on those you're thinking maybe feeding on other people's reactions and at that moment you don't want anything else you want that because you are the pain body at that moment there's an addiction to emotional pain so if you get drawn into a stream of negative thinking about life about other people about yourself about whatever it may be or one person [Music] which could be yourself or your partner or your father or some politician not mentioning any names and whenever you the image of that person comes into your head there's an enormous influx of pain but again we could easily misinterpret the pain body as [Music] personal and as unconsciousness being a personal shortcoming of someone but all that if it's a politician or your partner or whatever but all that is there is the expression of human unconsciousness and the pain body expressed in the words of jesus they know not what they do forgive them for they know not what they do or in the modern translation that hasn't been published yet they are completely unconscious and when that is the case they create suffering and when you react as if there were a person there who knows what he is doing you also become unconscious [Music] the reaction can make you unconscious the reaction can take you over and then your own pain body suddenly is there so and the pain body contributes to the fact that many people believe there's something wrong with them and there isn't it's the human pain body and the heavier it is in you because people have varying degrees of density in their pain body the more likely it is that it will drive you into consciousness because the pain gets too much i can't live like that anymore and then suddenly you notice it when it arises the first sign of it you may be able to catch a little event triggering an enormous reaction oh what's that and you notice that emotional movement inside you you're present what then happens we don't know the pain body may still arise depending on your degree of presence strange thing happens when the pain body comes up it uses an opportunity we mentioned the car could be your partner who makes a remark or comment that the pain body can use as an opportunity to arise what did you mean when you say that were you accusing me why are you accusing me i wasn't accusing you and yes you were accusing me and to observe it then as it arises whether you can do that depends on your degree of presence and it's quite possible that you can detect it for most people it works like this they become conscious just after it's happened the pain body episode has happened the pain body came up a drama developed perhaps with your partner or at work or some other member of your family or even with a stranger drama developed there was perhaps a lot of shouting and fighting and then pain body fed itself on the emotional pain and then subsided and went back to its dormant state and then consciousness some consciousness comes back what was that what was all that about sometimes partners can do it after the drama they can both say what was all that about and then you think how did it start we can't even remember what the whole thing was about in some cases they can't even remember what this how it all started it was about nothing in many cases much ado about nothing shakespeare's play and then they become conscious there was our pain body or there was my pain body that was it okay well let's see if next time we can catch it a little bit sooner and then usually it arises in one person before it triggers the reaction in the other so it can sometimes happen that one partner remains conscious and observes the arising of the pain body in the other and then perhaps can either point it out or if that's too dangerous can can simply be intensely present in the body and simply be there as an aware presence a non-reacting presence but that is requires great intensity of presence because the pain body is clever very clever it knows the weak points where you're most likely to react or if you think it's all too much for you you can quietly walk out of the room but who knows what happens after that of course as you know it's easier to see it in others than in yourself and if you're genuinely present and say there's your pain body it's starting the other person may become conscious at that moment and say yeah you're right or the pain body may already have taken possession of their thoughts so the person can no longer see it and a pain body then will never admit that he or she is the pain body of course if you ask are you the pain body [Music] they would not admit to it but they would probably tell you that you are the pain body or throw something at you or deny the whole thing all that nonsense about pain body so pain body is a great challenge it is not personal it does not mean there's something wrong with you usually as presence arises the gap went up between the ending of the pain body episode and the arising of conscious presence when you recognize what has happened gets shorter and shorter at first you might need an hour or two after an episode and then or even a day and then you look back what happened yesterday oh that was and then that shortens and then you may be able to be present either when it's not yet either has not fully arisen yet in its very early stages that of an emotional reaction trying to move into your mind and you may be able to catch it there and watch it or you may may be able to catch it as it begins to subside the episode is coming to an end and gradually you're getting tired of the drama it's exhausting of course and then that moment pain body is still partly there you catch it and say oh i can still feel it there it is it often happens very frequently that the it also happens very frequently that the pain body when it needs to feed on more pain comes up and you are there very present very alert and you see it so it meets presence the light of presence and in usually it it may stick around for a little while to see if it can get through there somewhere present by the way is not holding it down presence neither never exerts any effort on anything it never resists anything it presence never holds the pain body down in any way that is a dangerous thing one could do that through willpower i have no negative emotion because i'm spiritually advanced i'm just not seeing them i'm just not this don't exist and of course then they'll come out where you in very strange ways so you cannot hold the pain body down you can't for a short while and then it'll come up in the strangest ways and you do the weirdest things including physical violence or you inflict cruelty on people and don't even know it or you make your body very ill if the pain body has no other outlet it can become very destructive an unexpressed emotion charlie churning around you for years so presence never pushes it down it's it's simply a light into which it comes that's all the light of presence the light of awareness the light of consciousness the brain when it comes into the light the strange thing is it doesn't like the light so it will either try to obscure the light so that it can continue to pretend to be you it can take you over and become you for a while and live through you the emotion wants to live again through you another form of reincarnation the emotion wants to live again through you it wants to relive what it already knows what it makes up its energy field and so it cannot do that when there's presence when you are there you are actually there as the consciousness that watches then you can't do it so it may for a while it'll try you can see it comes up the little entity and there's a light shining on it and then it may try again coming up and you still just watch it and then it tends to shrink back into a little dark corner it waits for better opportunity it's uh and that's it's fine that's how it the whole this is how consciousness works it doesn't mean you're now totally free of pain body just at that moment it's gone down it's it's you're too conscious can't come in the evening perhaps it'll find a better opportunity when you lose consciousness through watching a certain politician on tv or your partner comes home late from work where have you been some upset happens one drink too many and there's his chance or her chance in certain it's more in males they're quite a few i don't know the percentage of the population it is frequently happens that in certain males the pain body comes up particularly when they drink too much and so they lose the level of consciousness that they normally have which may not be that high even at the best of times but when they get drunk it goes down considerably and so often violence is associated with being drunk for from in this perhaps what 10 percent of men they become physically violent when when they become unconscious through alcohol and they do dreadful things and then when they're sober against how could i have done such a thing i don't know what came over me and some have that cycle in you in their with their partner physically abusive and so of course when they're a little bit more conscious they always promise this was the last time it won't happen again no that's not the pain body speaking that's them speaking when there's a little bit more consciousness and of course it will happen again unless presence truly comes into their lives so in some cases you may have to physically remove yourself from a destructive pain body if change otherwise is not happening or would take too long you would not survive two more years with that person perhaps in that case you cannot stay around would be too dangerous that person will then go its own his or her own way and evolve it in their own time so pain body meets presence shrinks back then waits for better opportunity but as presence arises there's even the possibility that you could detect an active pain body in you even in the midst of it even in the midst of it it is possible to wake up and suddenly realize what's happening you are acting out old emotional pain and at that moment there happens a dissociation between that entire emotional field and yourself it's like stepping out of a of a role out of an energy field you were in it and suddenly you step out of that phantom self you step out and there you see it it's still there active still in you still doing what it does maybe still you're waving your arms apart or whatever it is and at that moment there may still be words coming out of your mouth you you and at that moment you see it wow and then it cannot last for long very much longer at least not right there it doesn't mean it's gone forever but then it will quickly shrink again back because it cannot consciousness and pain but it cannot coexist for long and every time you bring presents to it the pain body cannot renew itself so it can only operate out its old energy when you the more you can be present with it the less can it use you to renew itself and so it what happens then to the pain body the energy becomes freed that was trapped in there and many people have carrying so much pain that they can't do much else in their lives that absorb so much of their aliveness that they have little left to live their life the emotional pain and this is in the case of dense pain bodies the emotional pain is so much that it consumes them it's like a parasite it consumes them or their liveness and as we bring consciousness to it that trapped energy becomes freed it was trapped at a low frequency if you could hear it something like that you wouldn't want to listen to a radio station for too long like that and so that becomes freed but it is life energy it is aliveness ultimately and there is an increasing sense of aliveness that you feel because the energy leaves its trap into the pain body very much we could compare to uh i sometimes compared to a piece of heavy watch that's being burned so or coal the coal is transmuted into fire the flame of consciousness first it was it was a heavy substance dark and heavy substance and suddenly the dark and heavy substance burns it becomes a flame it becomes a transmutation into pure energy beautiful so that's and that is the beauty of it why ultimately whatever is is fine as it is or even the human pain body has a function [Music] and that is that it provides fuel for consciousness the pain it makes ultimately it becomes your spiritual teacher one of your spiritual teachers and for some people their main spiritual teacher i would say for me it was my main spiritual teacher because i couldn't live with him any longer so i couldn't live with myself any longer and a large part of myself when that realization came to me as a thought i cannot live with myself any longer a large part of who i felt myself to be consisted of emotional pain and that just became unbearable and that's why i'm here now so the the mechanism there of ultimately what is ego induced pain pain induced through unconscious living through ego pain body egoic living creates pain suffering it even needs the continuation of pain because the ego and the pain body they both need conflict they both need further pain the ego needs it to define itself through the other the enemy the not me it needs the boundary around itself it needs to create opposition [Music] in order to feel itself it needs somebody to disagree with me for example so that i can feel that i i i'm right he's wrong and in being right the illusion of who i am grows a little bit so i need that if everybody agrees with me in everybody i would begin to lose my artificial sense of self my mind made sense of self so religions often the collective identity that is in certain religions largely consists of the unbelievers those who are not us give us our identity we define ourselves through those unbelievers they give us our sense of who we are not that suddenly they all became believers we would be at a loss who are we now they're all in possession of the truth now so we lose our identity as the possessors of the truth if everybody's in possession of the truth who are we if we're at peace with everybody and we don't have enemies who are we if we don't define ourselves through our enemies not only collectively also personally people define themselves through that problematic life situation all the problems in their life situation make up that's my life me and my life [Music] so that artificial artificially induced sense of self disappears pain body pain is not who you are it's simply an energy that lives in you for a while and then becomes transmuted become friendly with your pain body may not yet be thankful for it i'm thankful now but at that time i wasn't thankful become friendly with your pain body this is the most powerful transformative tool so to speak because very often what manifests in the present moment is the pain body in you so if you are not making the now into an enemy if you become friendly with the now that will mean at times you have to become friendly with the pain body because you're experiencing that emotion now it's part of what is now and that is becoming friendly with it simply accept that it's there there it is i can feel it that implies of course that you know it's there which in turn implies of course that there's enough presence for you to see it you cannot become friendly with the pain body if you don't see it [Music] and the pain body's nature is not being friendly in itself so when you are the pain body you cannot become friendly with the present moment that's not what the pain really does so you see how it connects it's based on presence if there's presence in you then you can accept it then you can be friendly with it if there's not enough presence you can't be friendly with the pain body because then you are the pain body and the pain but is not friendly [Laughter] but once you are able to detect it and that's all that's required to know it's there then you can bring acceptance to it and say yeah yeah there it is whatever or simply just watch feel it wow feel the the raw emotion of it feel even the need to wanting somebody else to to draw in wanting someone else to draw in and make him or her part of that emotion feel what it feels like directly what does it feel like in you as an energy field amazing so you're watching it that's all that's all that's needed so you cannot really watch it internally if you don't fully accept it and you cannot fully accept it if you're not there as the witness as the watcher of it and that's all that's needed so pain body nothing wrong with you human humanity in its present evolutionary stage you can't escape that the present evolutionary stage of humanity has plain body nothing personal not a problem not your personal dilemma and by the way there's nothing personal in presence either the whole idea of person [Music] ultimately goes out of the window as you probably know the word person this comes from latin is based on the mask that actors used to wear in the early forms of theater persona the mask the image of me so presence isn't personal either and yet it's i am it's the essence of being of your being you and being a one the essence of what obscurely shines through the egoic story of me you feel there's a somewhere in there there is an i am in there somewhere but the i am gets mixed up with thought forms and memories and patterns in the mind it gets mixed up with a story there is something precious in the story but it's not the story it's the consciousness in the story even in a dream people say a dream is totally is unreal yes it's unreal but if there were not something real in there the dream couldn't even be for a dream to exist there must be something there that enables the dream the forms that make up the dream to exist what is it that enables the dream to exist consciousness it appears in consciousness what is it that enables the story of me to exist what is the essence of who i am somewhere hidden in that story i'm looking for myself in the different forms of the story and yet each form of the story concealed as the essence of that form is i am a sense of presence or beingness that's i'm hiding everywhere but hiding so well disguised that i can't even recognize myself so it's a walking around and everyone is god in heavy disguise so you can say i am god in disguise and the other person says oh i hardly recognized you or you could say you certainly did fool me [Laughter] [Music] and i fooled myself for a long time so everybody feels there's something precious to who i am and that is true but it's not really in the forms of my story or in the form of anything but hidden in the form the essence of each form of each thought that i have of each emotion that i have the essence that enables it to be is always the same it's always the one is the divine one self so that's also the dilemma the philosophical dilemma of whether the world is unreal or not so if anybody was planning to ask that question this afternoon you can't drop it the world is obviously as real as a dream that you have it has a certain reality yes and yet just like a dream the forms that make up the world change continuously that don't stay around for that long this continuous flux things come and go very quickly every experience everything is fleeting it's like a dream and then it's gone you say some people even don't know but occasionally they'd say did i dream it or did that happen because it's gone it's a it was a fleeting experience and it's dissolved as that experience what was that all about always one the chinese emperor who woke up from a dream and became very worried because he dreamt that he was a butterfly and then he suddenly thought maybe i'm a butterfly dreaming that i'm an emperor and it comes to the same thing the story of yourself is being dreamt by consciousness you could say how could it be otherwise and why is it happening because consciousness wants to dream that dream it's enjoying it on some level but consciousness also wants to wake up now otherwise we wouldn't be here this is not to provide the ultimate philosophical explanation of the universe because it would be impossible to do that through words or through thoughts but it's a slight hint of what it's all about it can only give a distant approximation of what it's all about never try to figure out through the mind what it's all about it's very heavy there's a knowing that comes when the need to figure out the universe is relinquished and you are happy with being alert and still and not knowing the answer if you become comfortable with not knowing then there is enormous wisdom and knowing in there how much of that you could ever put into words who knows maybe not very much how much of that will ever find expression who knows maybe only a tiny fraction that's okay so it's knowing finding who you are not as a character in the story of me not as a character in the dream but as the dreamer you're not a character in your own story but that's what the ego believes you you are of course the protagonist the main character the one character that really matters all the others are have supporting roles in the story of the ego supporting caste and then and then the rest of humanity and then the protagonists me and the me consists of a bundle of thought forms memories and then it dissolves sometimes it dissolves before the body dies when it becomes too painful to continue to be me sometimes it dissolves when a very serious illness comes or very serious disability comes and the image of me cannot hold itself up anymore and then you realize you are not the character you are the dreamer of the character the creator of the character the consciousness behind it all i've made it all up wow and it was never deadly serious it's only deadly serious it may be relatively serious but it's not deadly serious because it's only deadly serious if the forms that consciousness takes in the dream are all you know and every form is heavy and deadly and death is always around the corner and it's frightening but knowing yourself as the consciousness that changes the nature of the dream also it doesn't mean that the dream will immediately evaporate the dream actually becomes a more pleasant dream when you know when you are not totally lost in it you can continue to move in this world of form even your personal life continues the story of me of course continues you carry on doing certain things you've been doing that continues and yet there isn't a deeper dimension present now you no longer totally believe in the absolute reality of these forms you know they all come and go quickly you're not looking for yourself in the dream anymore that's the relief so you let the dream unfold it's fine but you're not looking for a stronger me or more complete me as that character in the dream that's the dream can't really do that for you and so it may well be and here we come to another cosmological viewpoint only a tentative not to be taken as some absolute statement the universe ancient teachings and more modern findings both point to the possibility that the universe may be expanding at something then like a heartbeat they say there was a big bang maybe maybe not maybe it's happening every moment and the universe came out of one point of nothingness nobody can actually explain that and suddenly manifestation happened and then it expanded and diversified and we may be still part of that and then at some point things come together again multiplicity arising out of oneness and yet the beauty is the oneness is never lost the point that was there before the universe ever came into being is still present in every being the timeless moment the timeless fullness of life unmanifested life that never really disappeared at some point the journey home begins for the entire universe back to oneness the journey home and what are what else is this gathering on the journey home so this may reflect something on a very small scale but it's all connected it's happening on a very large scale the beginning of the journey home to oneness because you discover the underlying essence and oneness of all life and of yourself and we couldn't do that if that were not part of a larger movement within the cosmos but we are simply an expression of that awakening out of the dream of multiplicity perhaps a dream had to be dreamt so that god can know him her itself as god only after losing itself in form and then waking up and it's all beautiful that waking up it is built into the dream the need to wake up and that's why the dream is meant to become unpleasant after a while because the unpleasantness of the dream the dream turning unpleasant is the built-in alarm clock in the dream pre-ordained built-in alarm clock that's the unpleasantness and after that has rang the another character appears in a dream called the spiritual teacher and the spiritual teacher says as the character in the dream don't you realize this is a dream and that you can you can wake up even while you're still dreaming this dream you can wake up and know who you are even in the dream and continue to play that character without totally believing in it anymore without losing yourself in the character this temporary form and then you see how much more pleasant the dream is and that may also you may know that all the very ancient myths in so many cultures have the story of the golden age the the very distant beginning of things when when there was when when beings lived in harmony in total harmony india has that story of the the yogas the original beginning of thing was when things perhaps were still closer to oneness and the more you get away from the oneness into diversification the more difficult things become the harder it gets because every form believes itself to be separate and then there's the promised return the return to the state of oneness so things start with the golden age so-called and then they deteriorate continuously but in the process of deterioration there's also a lot of learning of forms we learn of what all the things that make up the universe and then comes the return and as you go back to the source back to back home things the dream improves again but this time with consciousness with knowing so we paradise regained as one lit ancient literary work is entitled paradise regained and that is the purpose paradise regained is not quite the same as the original paradise it's conscious the original was natural natural oneness and then conscious oneness so this gathering here is part of a huge thing it's not an isolated phenomenon it's not even relegated to just this planet it must be connected with everything else in the cosmos otherwise it wouldn't be able to exist here at the gathering we wouldn't be sitting here talking about this and realizing this if you can become still whatever you truly need to know you'll know out of that stillness the answer suddenly comes the answer to every vital question is already in you not the answer to non-vital questions [Music] i recommend that between now and dinner time we keep normal silence as the buddha called it noble silence is to be present in the silence that's why it's normal otherwise it's just silence noble silence between now and dinner time we don't know of
